Open311Proxy
============


First Time Node Setup
---------------------

Install Node/NPM. You may want to use a program like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (or nave or nodenv) to manage different versions of node.

Because Open311Proxy was built to be used on Heroku, it contain a Procfile and `.env` file for use with Foreman.

Testing
--------

Install the jasmine-node package globally with `npm install -g jasmine-node`. Note: jasmine-node appears to be poorly maintained/abandoned.
